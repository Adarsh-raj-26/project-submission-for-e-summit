# README for Decentralized Voting App:
This application is a decentralized voting app built using blockchain technology. It allows users to vote in a secure and transparent way without the need for a centralized authority. The following tools were used in the development of this app:

Web3 JS - A JavaScript library that enables the client-side application to interact with the blockchain network.

Metamask - A browser extension that allows users to securely connect their browsers to the blockchain network.

Ganache - A local development blockchain that can be used for testing and development purposes.

Remix - A smart contract Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that enables developers to write, test and deploy smart contracts on the blockchain.

The app's frontend was built using React, and the smart contracts were written in Solidity. To use the app, users must have the Metamask browser extension installed and connected to the Ganache blockchain. The app provides a simple and intuitive interface for voting, with results being stored immutably on the blockchain.

Overall, this decentralized voting app provides a secure and transparent way for users to participate in voting without the need for a central authority.
